# Two Pointers
## When to Use
**searching for a pair** (or more) of items in an array that meet a certain criteria.

Examples:
- a pair of items that sum to a target
- a triplet of items that sum to 0 or a target.
- maximum amount of water that can be held between two array items representing wall heights.

# Sliding Window
## When to Use
**searching for a continuous subsequence** that satisfies a certain constraint

the length of the subsequence is known, use a fixed-length sliding window. 

Otherwise, use a variable-length sliding window.

Examples:
- Finding the largest substring without repeating characters in a given string (variable-length).

- Finding the largest substring containing a single character that can be made by replacing at most k characters in a given string (variable-length).

- Finding the largest sum of a subarray of size k without duplicate elements in a given array (fixed-length).
