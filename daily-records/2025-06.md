		1. set composition and cost to 1s, ignoring stock
		2. if budget is 100, our max k is 100
		3. considering stock, let's say 10 stock
		4. the max k is 100 + 10 which is `budget + stock`
		5. since I like to do binary search with `range(l, r)`, need to `+1`
		6. `max(stock)` will work as well, but with min can reflect tighter constraint
	4. good condition

		2. calculate the cost
			1. `max((base * mid - s) * c, 0)`
			2. sometime it would be negative  number because of big s, so using `max(x, 0)`

	1. `nums[i] -= 1 and nums[i -  1] += 1` means we can only move num from the end to the start
	2. at the end, the start `nums[0]` will be the min max of arr
	3. we can guess this number `k` with binary search
	4. range of k will be `(0, max(nums))` which is `[-1, max(nums) + 1]`
	5. good/check condition

		2. we want to find when `mid >= target` so we can set `r = mid`

				2. `target` has to be in as well  -> `target > end`
				3. and `mid >= target`, otherwise, `mid` will be on the left or `t` 
				4. => `target > end and mid >= target`
			2. `mid <= end`
				1. -> `mid` in the 2nd sorted part, or the whole array is sorted
				2. -> `target` can be in 1st or 2nd part
				3. if `target` in 1st
